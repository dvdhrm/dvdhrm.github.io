# About Me

Hey! I am *David Rheinsberg* (before 2018: *David Herrmann*). I write
[Free Software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software) and share my
thoughts and experiences about it here. If you ever meet me, be prepared to
catch and throw Frisbees or play some
[Ultimate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_(sport))!

## Open Source

Followingly, an incomplete list of open-source software I wrote or contributed
to (ordered alphabetically):

 * [**BlueZ**](http://www.bluez.org/): As part of the _xwiimote_ project, I
   worked on the input-device layer of the BlueZ Linux Bluetooth stack.

 * [**bus1**](https://bus1.org): Born from the ashes of the _kdbus_ project,
   the **bus1** project implements capability-based IPC for the linux kernel.

 * [**C-Util**](https://c-util.github.io): A collection of C utility libraries
   mostly extracted from the other projects I worked on, but maintained as an
   independent collection.

 * [**dbus-broker**](https://github.com/bus1/dbus-broker/wiki): Together with
   Tom Gundersen, I wrote a replacement for the D-Bus reference implementation,
   custom tailored for linux systems.

 * [**kmscon**](https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/kmscon/): As part of
   Google-Summer-of-Code I wrote a user-space console to replace the kernel
   VT subsystem.

 * [**Linux**](https://kernel.org): Starting with Nintendo Wii Remote device
   drivers, I have since spend my time on many different parts of the linux
   kernel. This includes new APIs (e.g., `bpf-lpm-trie`, `DRM-render-nodes`,
   `evdev-event-masks`, `EVIOCREVOKE`, `memfd_create(2)`,
   `NETLINK_LIST_MEMBERSHIPS`, `shm-sealing`, `SO_BINDTOIFINDEX`,
   `SO_PEERGROUPS`, `x86/sysfb`), maintenance work in graphics and
   input-handling subsystems (e.g., `Bluetooth`, `DRM`, `HID`) as well as some
   device drivers and driver subsystems (e.g., `BT-HIDP`, `UHID`,
   `HID-wiimote`, `simplefb`).

 * [**nettools**](https://nettools.github.io): Together with the NetworkManager
   group, we designed an independent, stand-alone, and unopinionated
   implementation of a set of networking protocols.

 * [**osbuild**](https://osbuild.org): As part of the **Image-Builder** group
   at Red Hat, I worked on the osbuild suite, which provides infrastructure to
   assemble operating system images.

 * [**r-efi**](https://github.com/r-efi/r-efi/wiki): A suite of Rust crates
   that provide a UEFI programming environment for the Rust programming
   language.

 * **srvx** & **ircu**: Back in the 2000s, I maintained a fork of
   [_ircu_](https://github.com/UndernetIRC/ircu2) and
   [_srvx_](https://github.com/GameSurge/srvx) for a German IRC network and
   backported bugfixes to the upstream projects.

 * [**systemd**](https://systemd.io): As part of the **Core OS** group at Red
   Hat, I worked on systemd and its subprojects.

 * [**Wayland**](https://wayland.freedesktop.org/): In the initial days of the
   Wayland project, I worked on its reference implementation, man-pages, and
   initial adopters like _wlterm_.

 * [**xwiimote**](https://dvdhrm.github.io/xwiimote/): Based on the excellent
   reverse engineering documents by the Wii-Homebrew group, I wrote a linux
   kernel device-driver for the Nintendo Wii Remote Controller, as well as some
   user-space components to interact with it.
